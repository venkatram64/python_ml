Multi Level Models:
The Concept is that some effects happen at various levels.
Example: your health depends on a hierarchy of the health of your cells, organs, you as
a while, your family, your city, and the world you line in.
Your wealth depends on your own work, what your parents did, what your grandparents did. etc,.
Multi level models attemp to model and account for these interdependencies.
